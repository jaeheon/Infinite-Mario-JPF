\section{Introduction}
Java PathFinder (JPF) is a stateful software model checker developed at NASA AMES Research Center. 
It is a \emph{software model checker} because it systematically explores all paths and inputs directly for software;
it is \emph{stateful} because it saves the program state after every logical operation. 

Although JPF is a model checker, it is used more often as a systematic testing framework. 
Compared with simpler abstractions often used for hardware model checking, software is much more complex with potentially exponentially many more states;
this quality makes exhaustive verification a difficult goal to attain.
